# Rainfall Crisis Analysis in Pakistan 🌧️🇵🇰

## Overview

As part of my **Scientific Data Analysis (CSCI 2000U)** course, I developed a comprehensive data analysis project focusing on the **rainfall crisis in Pakistan**. This project leverages Python's powerful data analysis ecosystem to uncover patterns, trends, and insights that could support better understanding and potential solutions to the crisis.

## Tools & Technologies

- **Python** – Core programming language for data analysis.
- **Pandas** – Used for efficient data manipulation and handling of complex datasets.
- **NumPy** – Performed numerical computations and supported array-based processing.
- **Matplotlib** – Created detailed plots and visual representations of the data.
- **Seaborn** – Enhanced visualizations with clean and informative statistical graphics.
- **Markdown** – Documented the entire process clearly to communicate insights and conclusions.

## Features

- 📊 **Data Cleaning & Preparation:** Loaded, cleaned, and transformed raw rainfall data.
- 🔍 **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Identified trends, anomalies, and correlations in rainfall patterns.
- 📈 **Visualization:** Developed clear and insightful charts for effective storytelling.
- 🧠 **Insight Generation:** Extracted key findings to support data-driven understanding of the rainfall crisis.
- 📝 **Well-Documented Workflow:** Used Markdown to present analysis, methods, and outcomes in an accessible manner.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the application of data science to real-world environmental issues. Through data manipulation, analysis, and visualization, I gained valuable insights into the rainfall crisis in Pakistan, showcasing the impact of data-driven approaches in scientific contexts.
