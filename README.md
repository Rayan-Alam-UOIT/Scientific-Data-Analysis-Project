For my assignment in the Scientific Data Analysis course (CSCI 2000U), I utilized **Python's** robust data analysis framework to develop a comprehensive solution for the rainfall crisis in Pakistan. I employed **Pandas** and **NumPy** for data manipulation and analysis, leveraging their powerful tools for data processing and numerical computations. For visualization, I used **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** to create clear and insightful charts, enhancing the interpretation of the data. Additionally, I incorporated **Markdown** to effectively communicate my ideas, analysis, and conclusions, ensuring that the thought process and findings were well-documented and easily understandable.
